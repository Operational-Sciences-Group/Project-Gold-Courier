## About

I needed a program that was lightweight and able to quickly parse logs collected by auditd. This tool allows for the complete control of your log files. It is capable of adding rules, removing logs, and searching date ranges. I recommend editing your 
auditd.conf to permanently retain logs while using this tool, or setting up logroate for your needs.
